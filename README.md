### **What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**

The projects in this course where to create a scheduling system. The code would read a list of courses stored in a csv file, store them in a course object, and then store the course objects in an appropriate data structure.

### **How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**

When selecting the appropriate data structure, I thought about the strengths and weaknesses of various data structures, and the requirements of the program. For example, the hash table supports fast insertions and searches, but the program required printing the full list of courses in alphanumeric order. This would have been difficult to implement using the hash table, so I went with the Binary Search Tree. Understanding the benefits of various types of data structures is important in order to select the appropriate data structure for your use case.

### **How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**

I never had issues with my code compiling, but I did have some issues with bugs in a few of my functions. I would carefully study the function to see if I could discover the bug, and added in print statements so I would which branches would execute. Using this method, I was able to discover and eliminate the bugs. 

### **How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**

Throughout this class, I have learned how to analyze algorithms' runtime complexities, and how to represent them in Big O notation. This will help me judge algorithms' efficiencies when designing software.

### **How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**

This course has taught me how to utilize data structures to write code that is maintainable and readable, and how to adapt those data structures to fit the data of my projects.
